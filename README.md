# LLVM Call graph analysis
This file reads a LLVM call graphs which represents the inte-function relationship in a design. It converts the graph (.dot format) into a human readable graph format. I represented graphs as an adjucancy matrix called .gph graph. We can analyze this graph to calculate resource and latency requirement of a top module.
